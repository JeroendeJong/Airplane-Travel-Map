Given were I live its not possible to get there at that unholy hour, so I had to spend the night in Bristol, and get the nights to Exeter. No sleep of course, But I saved 40£ at least. Anyway, arriving in Naples around 12 gives me enough time to explore the city. Tomorrow I’m taking the train to Catania to meet up with my family. \n\nOutside the airport everybody either gets a car or walks to the nearest bus stop.

Its called “Hostel of the Sun”, and is considered one of the better hostels. Which, I can agree on. The staff were super friendly making you feel at home straight away. When I was there plenty of co-travellers where there and immediately I made a few friends. Though, I didn’t go to Naples to sit in the hostel.

Though I had an opposite experience people were extremely friendly. '),
