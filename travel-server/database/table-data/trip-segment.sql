(3,2,E'place',E'Naples',E'Maradonna and pizza',E'I get a kick of out finding cheap (flight) tickets. That explains hopefully why I am crazy enough to Fly from Exeter at 9 in the morning. Given were I live its not possible to get there at that unholy hour, so I had to spend the night in Bristol, and get the nights to Exeter. No sleep of course, But I saved 40£ at least. Anyway, arriving in Naples around 12 gives me enough time to explore the city. Tomorrow I’m taking the train to Catania to meet up with my family. \n\nOutside the airport everybody either gets a car or walks to the nearest bus stop. I can’t drive so there is only 1 option: get the bus. The bus stops in front of my hostel; perfect. I booked 1 night in a hostel recommended by a friend. Its called “Hostel of the Sun”, and is considered one of the better hostels. Which, I can agree on. The staff were super friendly making you feel at home straight away. When I was there plenty of co-travellers where there and immediately I made a few friends. Though, I didn’t go to Naples to sit in the hostel. I spend the entire afternoon doing 2 things: eating pizza and walking around (mostly whilst eating pizza ;))\n\n… TBC',E'2019-07-21 09:30:00+00',E'2019-07-22 07:30:00+00',E'Naples is one of those cities people warn you about. “Be careful, lots of mafia and shady people walk around there.“ Or at least that’s what people said to me when I told them I booked a plane ticket to Naples.

Today I’m taking my flight to Morocco. It will be 23 degrees there today. I always feel less happy in the cold and dark days, and am therefore extra excited to go see the sun again!\n\nAs a side note I want to say that I paid more for the train tickets to the airport in London than for the return tickets to Morocco. I have no idea how Ryanair can afford that, but o well.\n\nThe flight was three and a half hours but I luckily managed to sleep through most of it. Arriving in Essaouria, you can straight away feel the warmer climate. Amazing. The airport is extremely small and has only two people checking our passports. It took quite some time. But i didn’t really mind, because I am on holiday.\n\nWhen there I realised there is no bus to the city, so I managed to find some other co-travellers and took a taxi to the city. Still not very cheap though! The streets are bustling with activity, markets everywhere. Really energetic and charming. I quickly managed to find the hostel thanks to the friendly taxi driver parking so close by.\n\nThe hostel owners are super friendly and after some repeating of my name they managed to pronounce it properly as well. I straight away met alit of nice people, quite of few of which also arrived on the same flight as me.\n\nI had a chat with a super friendly man called John. He explained to me there is a really nice and non tourist heavy restaurant that makes 1 meal. But they make it really well!\n\nAnd they did. Its was soup with vermicelli and a type of bread made of potatoes and vegetables. After eating the full meal I was pleasantly surprised it only cost me 10 dirham (about 1€). After thanking the old lady and paying, i spend the rest of the evening roaming around the city.\n\nAround this time all the fishermen are coming back and start selling their catch of the day. It really starts smelling like fish. Thats what you can expect in a city like this. One guy had his entire table filled with one fish, which after asked turned out to be Tuna. It was really fucking huge.\n\nTomorrow I think I will explore the city more, and maybe do a short day trip.

Luckily it\'s not a very big city, most people would call this a town even. But that doesn\'t mean there is nothing to explore!\n\nAt 9 am I was ready and decided to head to the beach first. The beach was really nice and started to get a bit busy already. Not so much sunbathing people, but mostly runners and a couple of football teams practicing for their next big game! I walked all the way to the last visible part of the beach from where you can see the city. Super relaxing! The warmth, the sun and the feeling of no worries about anything is amazing.\n\nAfter the beach I made my way back into the town, passing a whole bunch of embassies along the way. Not sure why there is a Korean embassy in this shitty town? On the way back I grabbed some deep fried dough with a sugar topping 😃. \n\nI was back at the hostel around 1 in the afternoon and after a chat with a hostel worker i decided to buy bus tickets to Marrakesh. Its about a three hour drive both ways, but i think it will be worth it. The bus leaves at 6:30 in the morning 😅 and I going back at 7 in the evening. So a good full day there.\n\nGetting back to the hostel, I decided to chill out on the roofterras and read a little. Time is flying past and before I know it its already 3. I promised myself i would explore the other side of the town. \n\nThere were a lot if markets on the other side. All if them selling used equipment like drills, irons, screws and bolts, everything you can think of. Further along it started turning into a proper garbage field. Crap everywhere. Really makes you think about all the plastic we just throw away. Its literes with plastic bags and other crap. Probably half of it from the sea. In between these garbage piles, people have dug out small rooms in which they have opened up shops to sell stuff. \n\nFurther along I find a residential area. Everybody here is really nice and friendly. Enthusiastically waving and shouting “Bonjour”. On the outskirts of the area you can see everybody is putting up their laundry to dry. Makes for a colourful sight.\n\nGoing back to the centre I eat and then go back to the hostel to prepare for tomorrow.

(39,9,E'Day Trip',E'Marrakesh',E'Day Trip to Marrakesh',E'For some reason I thought it was a good idea to book a bus ride to Marrakesh that leaves Essaouri at 6 in the morning. People in the hostel were just coming back, and yet i was brushing my teeth already. Thats ok though because Marakesh is promising to be a great day trip. And also for maximum amount of time it makes sense to leave early. \n\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/jeroen-travel-images/IMG_6239.jpg)\n\nThe bus arrived around 9 in Marrakesh and spend the morning leisurly walking through the parks and the big sqaure. Along the way a couple of people wanted to have a chat with me, but mostly to try and rip me off. In asia people would walk up to you out of honest curiousty, but here it seems more aimed towards making money over the dead body of the tourist. A shame.\n\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/jeroen-travel-images/IMG_9549.jpg)\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/jeroen-travel-images/IMG_1541.jpg)\n\nThe "big square" in Marrakesh, that every tourist will know when you ask them, is quite and that allowed me to roam around at ease and explore. Off the side there was a small market that sold some morrocan pancakes, served with honey. Honestly a great breakfast you should try. Simple, but well delicious. Sadly for me, there was a hole in the bottom of the paper and after a couple of minutes my entire pair of jeans and jacket was covered in honey. It was also my only pair of jeans for the holiday so im walking around like an idea. Great.\n\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/jeroen-travel-images/IMG_0099.jpg)\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/jeroen-travel-images/IMG_1653.jpg)\n\nAround the afternoon it started to get really busy and all the hustlers were also at large I found out. A friendly looking local informed me that the road was closed because of muslim prayer. Sounded a bit odd, but since I didn\'t want to offend anybody I went along. He would show me a way back to the "main street". Big mistake following him i realised later on. But he was nice and we had a bit of chat whilst walking through some increasingly back alley streets. A couple more minutes later my new friend turned around and suddenly demanding money. My heart skipped a beat because suddenly the situation became very clear. I was there on my own. No other tourists or frankly anybody else around me. He offered me a "tourist service" by guiding me around. Im trying to explain him that this is not a tourist service because, there is no "main road" visible. He however reassures me that its just around the corner. Bullshit ofcourse. Whilst I kept asking him way and saying that I didn\'t\' want to pay, his face started turning. His voice started to increase and soon i realised he was not taking no for an anwser. By this time his friend also joined the conversation also urging me to pay him. At that point my wallet was still firm in my jacket, and with no intention to grab it. Though when he started screaming that he now wants to fight me it was too much. I gave him 10 Dirham, around 1 pound. Good for a nice meal essentially. but he was still not happy.  This went of for a few minutes after which I gave another 10 and he gave up and I walked away.\n\nHeart pounding. Sweating. This is not what I enjoy about travelling. Certainly because you are on your own and corned. There is nowhere to run, nowhere to go. Also he looked quite muscialur and big. So that definitely didn\'t help. Soon I realised this is the area where this is common. Because around the corner, there was no "main road" but more hustelers trying to pull the same trick. Me now being educated as to how this works, I keep walking and moving along. Though they were also getting more aggressive and starting pushing. This went on for a little while, after which they lost hope. \n\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/jeroen-travel-images/IMG_3393.jpg)\n\nThe rest of the day I visited a museum and chilled out for a bit. The museum was only in French, which I can savely say is not my expertise. I know *baguette* and *fromage*, but thats about it. At some point I met this men In the picture below and bought a pair of glasses as a secret santa gift. Ofcourse a picture was required. What a legend. \n\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/jeroen-travel-images/IMG_6501.jpg)\n\nIn the afternoon the square was considerably more busy and the markets that have tourist adjusted prices where in full swing. People taking pictures with monkeys on leasings and snakes with rocks on their tails is a common sight there. It always makes me so mad seeing these people. But at the end of the day if the tourists are not paying them, they would not do this. So only blaming the locals is not fair, They are just trying to make some money. Tourists should know better. Don\'t take pictures for your entertainment of caged wild animals. Its not fun. nobody cares. \n\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/jeroen-travel-images/IMG_5926.jpg)\n\nDinner was some soup and potato pancake at a busy cafe where every single Moroccan men was fixiated to the only TV screen watching, from what i can tell some mediocre Indian drama TV show. The bus back left at 19:00 so it was time to head back.
