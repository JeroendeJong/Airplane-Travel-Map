(3,2,E'place',E'Naples',E'I get a kick of out finding cheap (flight) tickets. That explains hopefully why I am crazy enough to Fly from Exeter at 9 in the morning. Given were I live its not possible to get there at that unholy hour, so I had to spend the night in Bristol, and get the nights to Exeter. No sleep of course, But I saved 40£ at least. Anyway, arriving in Naples around 12 gives me enough time to explore the city. Tomorrow I’m taking the train to Catania to meet up with my family. \n\nOutside the airport everybody either gets a car or walks to the nearest bus stop. I can’t drive so there is only 1 option: get the bus. The bus stops in front of my hostel; perfect. I booked 1 night in a hostel recommended by a friend. Its called “Hostel of the Sun”, and is considered one of the better hostels. Which, I can agree on. The staff were super friendly making you feel at home straight away. When I was there plenty of co-travellers where there and immediately I made a few friends. Though, I didn’t go to Naples to sit in the hostel. I spend the entire afternoon doing 2 things: eating pizza and walking around (mostly whilst eating pizza ;))\n\n… TBC',E'2019-07-21 09:30:00+00',E'2019-07-22 07:30:00+00',E'/assets/naples_header.jpg',E'Naples is one of those cities people warn you about. “Be careful, lots of mafia and shady people walk around there.“ Or at least that’s what people said to me when I told them I booked a plane ticket to Naples.
