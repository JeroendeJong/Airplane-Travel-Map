(3,2,E'place',E'Naples',E'Maradonna and pizza',E'I get a kick of out finding cheap (flight) tickets. That explains hopefully why I am crazy enough to Fly from Exeter at 9 in the morning. Given were I live its not possible to get there at that unholy hour, so I had to spend the night in Bristol, and get the nights to Exeter. No sleep of course, But I saved 40£ at least. Anyway, arriving in Naples around 12 gives me enough time to explore the city. Tomorrow I’m taking the train to Catania to meet up with my family. \n\nOutside the airport everybody either gets a car or walks to the nearest bus stop. I can’t drive so there is only 1 option: get the bus. The bus stops in front of my hostel; perfect. I booked 1 night in a hostel recommended by a friend. Its called “Hostel of the Sun”, and is considered one of the better hostels. Which, I can agree on. The staff were super friendly making you feel at home straight away. When I was there plenty of co-travellers where there and immediately I made a few friends. Though, I didn’t go to Naples to sit in the hostel. I spend the entire afternoon doing 2 things: eating pizza and walking around (mostly whilst eating pizza ;))\n\n… TBC',E'2019-07-22 07:30:00+00',E'2019-07-21 09:30:00+00',E'Naples is one of those cities people warn you about. “Be careful, lots of mafia and shady people walk around there.“ Or at least that’s what people said to me when I told them I booked a plane ticket to Naples.

Along the way a couple of people wanted to have a chat with me, but mostly to try and rip me off. In asia people would walk up to you out of honest curiousty, but here it seems more aimed towards making money over the dead body of the tourist. A shame.\n\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/jeroen-travel-images/IMG_9549.jpg)\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/jeroen-travel-images/IMG_1541.jpg)\n\nThe "big square" in Marrakesh, that every tourist will know when you ask them, is quite and that allowed me to roam around at ease and explore. Off the side there was a small market that sold some morrocan pancakes, served with honey. Honestly a great breakfast you should try. Simple, but well delicious. Sadly for me, there was a hole in the bottom of the paper and after a couple of minutes my entire pair of jeans and jacket was covered in honey. It was also my only pair of jeans for the holiday so im walking around like an idea. Great.\n\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/jeroen-travel-images/IMG_0099.jpg)\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/jeroen-travel-images/IMG_1653.jpg)\n\nAround the afternoon it started to get really busy and all the hustlers were also at large I found out. A friendly looking local informed me that the road was closed because of muslim prayer. Sounded a bit odd, but since I didn\'t want to offend anybody I went along. He would show me a way back to the "main street". Big mistake following him i realised later on. But he was nice and we had a bit of chat whilst walking through some increasingly back alley streets. A couple more minutes later my new friend turned around and suddenly demanding money. My heart skipped a beat because suddenly the situation became very clear. I was there on my own. No other tourists or frankly anybody else around me. He offered me a "tourist service" by guiding me around. Im trying to explain him that this is not a tourist service because, there is no "main road" visible. He however reassures me that its just around the corner. Bullshit ofcourse. Whilst I kept asking him way and saying that I didn\'t\' want to pay, his face started turning. His voice started to increase and soon i realised he was not taking no for an anwser. By this time his friend also joined the conversation also urging me to pay him. At that point my wallet was still firm in my jacket, and with no intention to grab it. Though when he started screaming that he now wants to fight me it was too much. I gave him 10 Dirham, around 1 pound. Good for a nice meal essentially. but he was still not happy.  This went of for a few minutes after which I gave another 10 and he gave up and I walked away.\n\nHeart pounding. Sweating. This is not what I enjoy about travelling. Certainly because you are on your own and corned. There is nowhere to run, nowhere to go. Also he looked quite muscialur and big. So that definitely didn\'t help. Soon I realised this is the area where this is common. Because around the corner, there was no "main road" but more hustelers trying to pull the same trick. Me now being educated as to how this works, I keep walking and moving along. Though they were also getting more aggressive and starting pushing. This went on for a little while, after which they lost hope. \n\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/jeroen-travel-images/IMG_3393.jpg)\n\nThe rest of the day I visited a museum and chilled out for a bit. The museum was only in French, which I can savely say is not my expertise. I know *baguette* and *fromage*, but thats about it. At some point I met this men In the picture below and bought a pair of glasses as a secret santa gift. Ofcourse a picture was required. What a legend. \n\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/jeroen-travel-images/IMG_6501.jpg)\n\nIn the afternoon the square was considerably more busy and the markets that have tourist adjusted prices where in full swing. People taking pictures with monkeys on leasings and snakes with rocks on their tails is a common sight there. It always makes me so mad seeing these people. But at the end of the day if the tourists are not paying them, they would not do this. So only blaming the locals is not fair, They are just trying to make some money. Tourists should know better. Don\'t take pictures for your entertainment of caged wild animals. Its not fun. nobody cares. \n\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/jeroen-travel-images/IMG_5926.jpg)\n\nDinner was some soup and potato pancake at a busy cafe where every single Moroccan men was fixiated to the only TV screen watching, from what i can tell some mediocre Indian drama TV show. The bus back left at 19:00 so it was time to head back.

The hostel was so kind as to arrange all of that for me with another fellow traveler so the price would be less. The airport does not accept any mobile boarding passes, so one of my tasks for the day was to print my boarding pass somewhere. Never in my life have i been in a internet cafe, but today was the day. The computers were all atleast 10 years old and the keyboard looked like multiple people vomitted over it and let it dry. It was pretty bad, not gonna lie. The internet was very slow, and the keyboard was in AZERTY instead of QWERTY layout. However when travelling is all about overcoming (simple) challenges, after some effort i managed to the a4 paper with my boarding pass printend out.
